<h1 style = "text-align: center;">Week 8: CNC + Molding and Casting</h1>
<br>

<p class = "margin"></p>
The week, we were trained on the CNC machine and various methods of molding and casting.
With this new skill set under our belt, we were assigned to build something using the CNC and mold+cast something.
<br><br>
Thinking forward to my final project, I knew that I wanted to this assignment mold+cast a casing for my device.
I started by starting on Fusion to draw the base of the device casing and switched to blender to build onto the base (as seen below).

<image style = "width: 80%" src = "8.2.png" alt = "Picture" class = center> </image><br>
However, thinking about the shape, I knew that I would be unable to CNC the mold for the case. 
I decided to resin print the mold in order to cast it with semi-flexible material so that it is easily wearable.
I brought the file back to fusion to make the mold from the negative of the 3D model and adding.

The two halves of the mold and the actual 3D design of the device was brought into the resin printer and printed.
