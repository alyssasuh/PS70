<h1 style = "text-align: center;">Week 2: 2D Design and Cutting</h1>
<br>

<p class = "margin"></p>
This week, I learned how to CAD on Fusion. 
I have experience working on other CAD softwares such as Solidworks and OnShape so transitioning felt relatively minimal.
That said, it was my first time applying my CAD skills to a laser cutter, which was a fun learning experience adjusting to the new tool.

<p class = "margin"></p>
The concept of my box was inspired by a combination of a dice and the Mrs.Potato Head Toy.
In other words, I wanted to animate a simple box with human features incorporated into the design.
Feet, ears, nose, and lips.

I drew out the flattened schematic of the box, lid, and the remaining body parts.
This was used as a guide for the CAD.

<br><p class = "margin"></p>
However, I soon realized that I liked the box better without any facial features so I decided to keep it blank.

Through the first iteration of the box, I realized that I could scale the model up so that I could fit more into the box. 
I increased the sides of the box from 10cm to 15cm while keeping the remaining body parts and slots the same as the previous iteration.

<p class = "margin"></p>
In addition to the box, I was able to further excersie my CAD-ing skills on Fusion 360 through following an 
<mark2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDCnFoE_lZ0">online tutorial</a></mark2>
walked me through designing a bottle cap.
Seemingly simple, I know from prior experience that knowing how to thread and clone ridges is an essential skill that is regularly used.
For this reason, I found this video to familiarize myself with these tools on the software.

<h2 style = "font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Modeling Assembly</h2>
<p class = "margin"></p>
The last compenent of this weeks' assignment was to apply our CAD skills to everyday objects, with the goal of creating an assembly out of these objects.
I decided to draw out a case for my airpod pros on Onshape, the CAD program I'm most familiar with thus far.
First, I able to retrieve precise dimensions of the object by a combination of open sources measurements online (for curved surfaces) and on my own with a caliper.

<p class = "margin"></p>
Due to various curvatures on the airpods, drawing out the case became a bit more complicated than expected especially since the case needed to fit perfectly around the device.
I ended up duplicating the shape of the airpods, scaling it up around the original sketch and shelling it (adding tolerance).
I split the hollowed out case at the line of the opening of the airpod case, and added additional features such as the keychain hole and charging port separately.
Finally, I took all the parts to the assembly tab (my first time using this feature on Onshape) and put all the components together in a relation such that the airpod case slides on and off of the airpod sketch.
