<h1 style = "text-align: center;">Week 5: 3d Design</h1>
<br>

<p class = "margin"></p>
This week's objective was familiarizing ourselves with 3D printing. 
With our aquired CADing skills, we applied this knowledge to fabricate objects that would not be possible to manufacture with subtractive methods. 
I utilized this week to plan for the upcoming final project.

<p class = "margin"></p>
One part of the assignment was to scan an object with either photogrammetry or LIDAR.
I scanned my ear. 
Scanning proved to be more difficult than expected- specificially a body part that could not be readily manipulated.
The scanner could not pick up the surface of the back of my ear because of the shadow that was casted from my head and hair.

<p class = "margin"></p>
However, with a kind helping hand, a scan was eventually made. (Shoutout to Kassia and Bobby!)

<p class = "margin"></p>
In continuation of the scanning assignment, I brought my ear to Blender as an attempt to patch up the scan and print it.
Little did I know that this would be the most time consuming part of the week!
I spent an entire day manually patching up the holes and reshaping the rough edges, but whenever I would bring the mesh into Fusion 360, it would shoot me an error that couldn't be resolved unless all of the holes were patched.
Fusion would patch up the holes on its own which would affect the overall shape of the ear.

<p class = "margin"></p>
By the second day- just when I was about to call it quits- I thankfully noticed a "remesh" feature on blender on the top right corner of the window.
<p class = "margin"></p>
<image style = "width: 80%" src = "5.4.png" alt = "Design" class = center> </image><br>

<p class = "margin"></p>
The software remeshed the ear at a resolution so large that it took 10 minutes to compile the file. 
But the detail on the mesh resulted in the software inadvertendly patching up all of the holes on the surface while taking care of all of the miscellanious patches embedded inside of the ear that I could not get to.

Zoomed in image of remeshed ear to show resolution: 
<p class = "margin"></p>
<image style = "width: 80%" src = "5.6.png" alt = "Design" class = center> </image><br>
<p class = "margin"></p>
I brought this file back into the Fusion (which took another 10 minutes to load) and remeshed the file to a smaller resolution.
<p class = "margin"></p>
<image style = "width: 80%" src = "5.7.png" alt = "Design" class = center> </image><br>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Once I was satisfied with the mesh resolution, I saved this file again and brought it back into Blender to finalize the mesh to the desired shape.
This mesh was brought into Fusion one last time to be scaled and exported as an STL and converted into G-code.

With the intension of having this ear to model and hold my wearable device for my final project, I printed the object in TPU filament.

<h2 style = "font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Final Project</h2>
<p class = "margin"></p>
As alluded to with the printing of the ear, I think I am finalizing my project towards a wearable device that will fit into my piercings. 
To ensure a perfect fit, I spent a lot of time perfecting the shape of the ear so that I could design the hardware to work around the shape.
