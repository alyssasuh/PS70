  This project served as the culmination of nearly all the prior weeks' assignments, integrating skills such as CAD, sensor implementation, miniaturization with ESP32 Xiaos, custom PCBs, and molding and casting. 
  Each small component was developed with the final project in mind.

  <h2 style = "font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">CAD</h2>
  The first critical task was designing and ordering a custom PCB to integrate and further miniaturize the electronics. 
  With the PCB completed, I had the freedom to focus on designing the enclosure. 
  I spent considerable time creating a compact encasing that seamlessly integrated with the ear cuff I had designed during CNC week.
  The most time-consuming part was accounting for key features such as the charging port, an opening for the bone conductor, and screw fittings to allow for a non-permanent enclosure. 
  Additionally, I delibrately subtracted the mesh shape of the cuff from the encasing to ensure the cuff fit perfectly.

  After working with plastisol and sillicone, I took a piviot back to resin printing.

  Unfortunetly, I ran out of time to get the nice video edit of the project in time and uploaded. 
  Below is the demo video I took the day of final presentations. 
  I will be reuploading a completed version of the video on my own time soon!
