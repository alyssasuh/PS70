  This project served as the culmination of nearly all the prior weeks' assignments, integrating skills such as CAD, sensor implementation, miniaturization with ESP32 Xiaos, custom PCBs, and molding and casting. 
  Each small component was developed with the final project in mind.

  The first critical task was designing and ordering a custom PCB to integrate and further miniaturize the electronics. 
  With the PCB completed, I had the freedom to focus on designing the enclosure. 
  I spent considerable time creating a compact encasing that seamlessly integrated with the ear cuff I had designed during CNC week.
  The most time-consuming part was accounting for key features such as the charging port, an opening for the bone conductor, and screw fittings to allow for a non-permanent enclosure. 
  Additionally, I delibrately subtracted the mesh shape of the cuff from the encasing to ensure the cuff fit perfectly.

  After experimenting with plastisol and silicone, I pivoted back to resin printing upon discovering that flexible resin had been available in our storage all along. 
  Following a test print to evaluate the material's flexibility, I moved on to integrate the same copper wire used previously in the silicone cuff into the clear flexible resin. 
  To accomplish this, I modified the 3D model by cutting a thin groove where the wire could be embedded.
  <br><br><image style = "width: 70%" src = "13.4.png" class = center> </image>
  Once the print was completed and cured, I carefully bent the copper wire to fit snugly into the groove and secured it in place with superglue. 
  I then applied a thin coat of clear resin over the wire using a brush and cured it. 
  This process was repeated several times to fully embed the wire within the print and to ensure the cuffâ€™s finish matched the rest of the design's shine. 
  Finally, I smoothed out rough edges and any drips left by the supports using sandpaper, achieving a polished and cohesive look.

  Unfortunetly, I ran out of time to get the nice video edit of the project in time and uploaded. 
  Below is the demo video I took the day of final presentations. 
  I will be reuploading a completed version of the video on my own time soon!
