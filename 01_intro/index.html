<br>

<h2 style = "font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Personalized Website</h2>
<p class = "margin"></p>
This was my first time designing a website!
Though I have extensive experience working in Matlab, my coding experience quickly falls short outside of this scope.
I was pleasently surprised to have this much fun working in HTML and CSS, putting this site together.
<br><br>
I have tweaked around with the original template, reformatting the site to my liking. 
This includes the cursor, which I found on an 
<mark2><a href="https://themediary.tumblr.com/cursors2">old Tumblr webpage</a></mark2>
originally designed to help other people customize their own page, but I was able to modify for my own use.
Additionally, I have been designing all of the characters and icons seen throughout this site.

<h2 style = "font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Final Project Proposal</h2>
<p class = "margin"></p>
I’m currently torn between developing a project that aligns more closely with my academic interests, making it more experimental, or creating something simpler and more functional.
Ideally, I would like to find a project that is both, but that sounds easier said than done.
Here is an chatoic set of ideas I have put together so far: 
<p class = "margin"></p>


<br>
<h4>Idea 1 : [A Wearable Device]</h4>
<image style = "width: 90%" src = "1.1.png" alt = "Wearable Device Sketch" class = center> </image> 
<p class = "margin"></p>

A fashion-forward product either in the form of sunglasses or a device that would intergrate into my piercings. 
I envision both devices having headphones intergrated into the system. 
Possibly utilizing bone conduction technology? (tbd) to be programmed to monitor posture, alarms, and daily tasks.

<br>

<h4>Idea 2: [Conceptual Sculpture of the Circulatory System]</h4>
<image style = "width: 30%" src = "1.2.png" alt = "Sculpture Sketch" class = center> </image> 
<p class = "margin"></p>

The idea stems from my work and interest in hearts.
I will be able to apply my knowledge of the human body to model the sculpture while exercising the technical skills gained from this class.
The concept is very open ended which will allow me to be more creative with the final product.

<h4>Idea 3: [Automated Crested Gecko Feeder]</h4>
<image style = "width: 90%" src = "1.3.png" alt = "Gecko Feeder Sketch" class = center> </image> 
<p class = "margin"></p>

This idea is the most functional and straight-forward final product out of the three. 
My family has a crested gecko named "둥이" (cutie pie in Korean) at home that needs to be misted atleast once a day and fed every two days.
Sometimes, we go on weekend trips that warrents us to find someone to take care of her while we're gone. 
I have thought about creating a automated feeding system in the past, but didn't feel like I had the tools and resources to make it happen.
The system would need a monitoring feature, be relatively quite, and reliable.
