<h1 style = "text-align: center;">Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication</h1>
<br>

<p class = "margin"></p>
The objective for this week was familiarizing ourselves with shop tools and moter mechanisms.
With this knowlege, we were tasked to create a kinetic sculpture for this weeks' assignment that includes a simple moter and a power source.

<h2 style = "font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">The Design</h2>
<p class = "margin"></p>
I decided to expand on my box design from this past week's assignment <mark2><a href="../02_2Ddesign/index.html">(2D Design)</a></mark2> by adding a mechanical eye that blinks.
I envisioned a "ferby"-esque vision for my kinetic sculpture.

<p class = "margin"></p>
For the physical mechanism, I imagined a gear system attached to a hinged arm. 
I would need to slow down the fixed moter speed with a combination of gear series and gear ratio.
My largest concern was fitting all of the system neatly into the box.

But before I get to the mechanical structure of the sculpture, I had to modify the body of the creature.
I did this with adding a hole in the face of the box and adding a sphere (eyeball) and half sphere (eyelid) fitted into eachother.

The eye and eyelid was 3D printed and skewered on a rod which I secured on a frame fitted for the body of the box. 
Furthermore, the frame was secured onto the box with screws that bore through the box from the bottom. 
Similarly, I CADed a quick stand to securely hold my moter in place.

<h2 style = "font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Trial and Error</h2>

<p class = "margin"></p>
I removed the back wall of the body for easy access to the mechanical components in the time being. 
I will for attach it back onto the body for next week's assignment as it is most important for me to focus on having a working mechanism for this week rather than the overall asethetic.
I started off with simplying experimenting with varying lengths of the hinged arms, wire configuration, and moter placement.

I realized that the gear was too small so I had to increase the size from d=50mm to d=65mm as an attempt to increase the amount I was able to open the eyelid.

<h2 style = "font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Final Product</h2>
<p class = "margin"></p>
Once I was satisfied with the overall movement of the mechanism, I secured the moter down to the final placement.

I plan on finalizing the overall aesthetic of the sculpture for next week's assignment as I plan to continue improving this mechanism for the micocontroller assignment...
